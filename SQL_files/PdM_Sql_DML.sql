/* 
   Data for staging tables was imported using the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard.
   The source data files were in CSV format, and each file was mapped to the corresponding
   staging table under the 'stg' schema. 
   Column mappings and data types were verified during the import process to ensure compatibility
   with the existing table schema. The import operation used the "Append Rows" option to add data
   to existing staging tables without overwriting or truncating any previous data.
